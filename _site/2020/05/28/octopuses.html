<p>The octopus (plural octopuses) is a soft-bodied, eight-limbed 
mollusc of the order Octopoda.</p>

<p>Around 300 species are recognised, and the order is grouped within
the class Cephalopoda with squids, cuttlefish, and nautiloids. Octopuses 
have a complex nervous system and excellent sight, and are among the 
most intelligent and behaviourally diverse of all invertebrates.</p>
